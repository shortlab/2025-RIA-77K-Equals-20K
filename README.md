Data repository for Aurelien's manuscript on lack of thermal annealing in irradiated optical fibers at 77K

Data supporting the experiments can be found in the "Experiments" folder. It includes the code used to synchronize the instruments (Arduino TTL trigger box), which complements information given in the article to reproduce this experimental setup. The "Experimental results for article" folder contains compressed folder with the experimental data (transmitted spectra and temperature data), stamps to identify key moments of each experiments in the spectrometer data, the analysis codes in jupyter notebooks, and python modules that can be used for gaussian decomposition, spectrum smoothing and noise region removal.

The supporting data repository can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15109936. It contains some of the data files that are too heavy for a GitHub repository.

More information regarding the experimental setup can be found in a previous article "A cryogenic white light absorption spectroscopy setup with in situ gamma irradiation and thermo-optical annealing for optical fiber radiation-induced attenuation characterization" (https://github.com/shortlab/2025-RIA-RSI).
